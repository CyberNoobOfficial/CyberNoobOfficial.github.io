Incident response is a crucial part of cybersecurity, but it can be time-consuming and complex. Fortunately, PowerShell can help automate many incident response tasks and make the process more efficient. In this post, we'll look at 3 useful PowerShell scripts that can help with incident response.

## 1. User Account Enumeration

One common task in incident response is to identify all the user accounts on a system. This can help you determine which accounts might have been compromised and need to be investigated further. The following PowerShell script can help automate this process:

``
Get-LocalUser | Select-Object Name
``

This script will enumerate all the local user accounts on the system and display their names. You can use this script to quickly identify all the user accounts on a system and determine which ones might need to be investigated further.

## 2. Process Enumeration

Another common task in incident response is to identify all the processes running on a system. This can help you determine which processes might be malicious and need to be terminated. The following PowerShell script can help automate this process:

``
Get-Process
``

This script will enumerate all the processes running on the system and display their names, IDs, and other information. You can use this script to quickly identify all the processes on a system and determine which ones might be malicious and need to be terminated.

## 3. Network Connection Enumeration

In some cases, you may need to identify all the network connections established by a system. This can help you determine which connections might be malicious and need to be terminated. The following PowerShell script can help automate this process:
``
Get-NetTCPConnection | Select-Object LocalAddress, LocalPort, RemoteAddress, RemotePort
``
This script will enumerate all the TCP connections established by the system and display their local and remote addresses and ports. You can use this script to quickly identify all the network connections established by a system and determine which ones might be malicious and need to be terminated.

## 4. Conclusion
PowerShell can be a valuable tool for incident response, as it allows you to automate many common tasks and make the process more efficient. These 3 scripts are just a few examples of the many ways that PowerShell can be used for incident response. By using PowerShell, you can more effectively respond to incidents and protect your systems from harm.
